Welcome to Cubical Productions! My name is Seth, and this is a little bit of what I do.

Cubical Productions began in 2013 with the goal of exploring my passion in video production and editing. I started making videos using Mojang's smash hit "Minecraft" video game, and over the years I have worked everything from school video projects to audio recordings to weddings. The support of my family and friends has allowed me to grow so much, and my work will only get better from here, so be sure to check back on this site every now and then for samples of my latest projects!
